    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>4 (5 oz)</strong> skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li><strong>2 tbsp </strong> olive oil</li>
        <li><strong>1/2 tsp</strong> coarse sea salt</li>
        <li><strong>1 pinch</strong> creole seasoning</li>
        <li><strong>1 tbsp</strong> chicken broth</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to <strong>400 degrees F (200 degrees C)</strong>.</li>
        <li>Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkle both sides with salt and Creole seasoning. 
            Place chicken in a broiler pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for <strong>10 minutes</strong>. 
            Flip chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about <strong>15 minutes</strong> more. 
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least <strong>165 degrees F (74 degrees C)</strong>.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken to a plate.</li>
        <li>Pour chicken broth into the pan and scrape any browned bits off the bottom with a flat-edged wooden spatula. 
            Add more broth if needed to dislodge the browned bits, but not too much or it will be watery.</li>
        <li>To serve, drizzle the pan sauce over the chicken.</li>
    </ol>
